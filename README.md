# Mechanisms of kelp forest recovery
This is the GitHub repository for a project led by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Sea Otter Research and Conservation Team. The purpose of this project is to evaluate mechansisms of kelp forest recovery, including sea otter population responses to changing kelp forest ecosystem dynamics. 

## Respository structure 

The GitHub repository contains all of the code associated with the project and the figures produced by this code. 

The data for the project are kept in a server outside the GitHub repository. Non-confidential data will be made available in a public data repository upon project completion.

The GitHub repository has the following structure

* **data:** This folder contains subfolders for each dataset used in the project. The subfolders contain scripts that clean and visualize the data. Figures for visualizing each dataset are contained within a *figures* folder inside each subfolder.
* **analyses:** This folder contains subfolders that contain the analyses conducted for each paper. 

## Repository best practices

Project contributors are internal at this point in time. We ask that contributors adhere to the following best practices when working in the repository:

1. Use lower case for all folders and file names
2. Use underscores for spaces (don't use hyphens or spaces)
